## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Let me introduce myself - my name is Rahman Afifudin.

I am an RPA Developer at [Sazanka Henig](https://www.sazankahenig.com/).

I'm responsible for automating processes across applications, websites, emails, and documents using tools like UiPath and Power Automate.

I've been [certified by UiPath](https://credentials.uipath.com/1e2d4b7c-7683-451c-a83c-4ba9cc3a9698#acc.3W0sA2lq) since 2024.

Currently, I'm learning about machine learning as well as web and application development.
